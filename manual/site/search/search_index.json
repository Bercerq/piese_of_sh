Once the adscience segment pixel has been placed on the Advertiser\u2019s website creating and targeting (or excluding) new segments is very easy. Step 1: Navigate to segments Click on segments tab within the specific Advertiser Step 2: Copy segment pixel Copy the specific segment pixel code from the bottom of the page and make sure it is placed on any page where you would want to retarget its visitors. Note The advertiser is responsible for obtaining the consent of visitors to place cookies and retarget the person (for example through a cookie consent module). Step 3: Create a first segment. At the Segments tab for the specific Advertiser click the +Create segment button: A name for the specific segment (For example \u201cAll visitors\u201d) The domain for which visitors need to be added to the segment.

General Name The Name of the Campaign Period The start and end date (with an optional addition of time) It also includes a number of settings which have not been set just yet: Delivery The way the Campaign should distribute the set budget over the chosen budget period. Campaigns automatically increase and decrease the height of their bids to spend the budget as evenly as possible over the selected budget period. Evenly : the budget is distributed as evenly as possible. Frontloaded : the Campaign tries to spend a little more earlier during the period, reducing the chance of under delivery of the budget if issues arise later during the period. As fast as possible : the Campaign has no regard for the length of the budget period, but simply tries to spent the entire budget as fast as possible. Note As fast as possible is not a recommended setting. It will usually disable machine learning optimizations and lead to a higher CPM price than needed. Using As fast as possible will not fix issues where a campaign is behind on its schedule due to a lack of available inventory; in these cases expanding the targeted inventory or the maximum allowed bid price is necessary. Day parting Allows the exclusion of bidding during days or parts of days. Campaign group Allows assigning the Campaign to a group of campaigns that share similarities. Campaign remarks Allows you to set notes about the campaign. This can be particularly helpful to keep track of adjustments during the campaign especially if you work in a team. Campaign remarks are also shown on \u201cmouse over\u201d of the campaign name in any tab that is called Campaigns .

It also does not increase the likelihood of winning campaigns; if a campaign is behind on the intended schedule, bids are already increased to the maximum bid price. Max impressions Limits the campaign to a maximum number of impressions. This can either be a daily limit or a limit on the entire campaign duration. Just like for the budget, the setting of Delivery affects how the impressions are distributed over the selected period. User Frequency Capping Controls how often an ad is allowed to be served to a single viewer.

Sub-strategies allow you to allocate a percentage of the budget and - if set - the maximum number of impressions. For more information about when to use Substrategies you can check the Advanced Substrategy section Creating a Sub-strategy To create a sub-strategy , click the +Create sub-strategies button This opens up 2 new sub-strategies. For each you can specify a name And a percentage of the budget and - if set - the maximum number of impressions. Note The percentages do not have to sum up to 100%, if they sum up to some other number, then they will be used as weights rather than as percentages. For example: A Campaign has 2 strategies: Strategy A is assigned 10% of the budget Strategy B is assigned 10% of the budget This effectively means that both strategies get 50% of the campaign budget. This also means that the entire budget will be spent, and not just 20% of it. If the total percentage exceeds 100%, then the same thing will happen, as the campaign budget will be respected. Each strategy should be assigned 1 splitting targeting rule which makes the strategy \"different\". Typically all sub-strategies will have at least 1 targeting rule of the same attribute. For example each sub-strategy has a targeting rule required for bid, domain . Where strategy 1, targets a number of domains related to sports, and strategy 2, targets a number of domains related to finance. Initially both strategies get equal parts of the budget (50%) However after studying the results, it turns out that the \"sports strategy\" performs much better. The sports strategy is therefore given a larger portion of the budget by increasing the set percentage. In addition, it may be interesting to add Ads specifically for each Sub-strategy , this can be accomplished by creating a required for bid rule on the attribute Ad (in addition any other splitting targeting rules). This can for example be used to do story telling, by combining rules based on the number of User interactions (impressions) with certain Ads. Sub-strategy options A/B testing (distribute users using percentages) , if you want to run a scientific A/B test, then using this option might be useful. Each potential Viewer is pre-assigned to a sub-strategy, which makes it impossible for other sub-strategies to target that Viewer . This prevents contamination within your results where 1 sub-strategy first \"warms up\" a Viewer by serving a number of Ads to him and then strategy 2 comes in and swoops in the viewer with a click and follow up conversion . Note by selecting this option, you limit the number of viewers each strategy can target, it is therefore typically not recommended. Do not redistribute unspent budget between sub-strategies , quite often when distributing the budget between strategies it happens that 1 strategy targets a very specific group for which it is not possible to spend the entire budget, given within the Campaign's targeting parameters.

Below we have listed a few of these scenarios: Using different Ad sets. If you would like to use different Ads or different sets of Ads within a specific Campaign where each Ad (set) gets a specific part of the budget. For each set a substrategy is created. By adding a \"required for bid\" rule on the attribute Ad and selecting each of the intended ads, a substrategy bidding only for that set of Ads is created. Using the Substrategy's percentage, you can control how often a specific Ad (set) is shown. Using different Ad sets for different attributes. The previous scenario can further be expanded to dedicate specific Ad (sets) to specific geographic regions, websites, or any other targeting attribute you may wish to use. Create a Substrategy as described above Add an additional \"required for bid\" rule on an additional attribute, for example \"Region\" to match a specific region to a specific Ad (set) This makes sure that the Substrategy only bids for that region with the chosen ads. Note For geographic targeting around a potentially large number of stores the ORTEC | adscience system contains the Retail module (MAKE LINK), which is designed for the specific purpose of showing different ads for specific areas. Performance versus cost management. In some cases you might have your inventory grouped in different sets of comparable quality. One set is high in quality, but costly. Another is lower in quality, but cheaper. Ideally, you may want to balance between the two, to get overal performance for a reasonable cost. By using substrategies you can easily reevaluate and adjust the percentage of both sets while the Campaign is running. If the Campaign is not performing well enough, then you can increase the amount of high quality inventory. If the Campaign is overperforming at the cost of margin, then you might want to decreate the amount of high quality inventory. Story telling If you're interested in showing your viewers specific ads based on which ads they have seen before then Substrategies can be very useful. Create a Substrategy for each specific Ad Add a \"required for bid\" Ad rule for each Substrategy Add a \"required for bid User interaction rule set to impressions Choose how much time may have passed since the viewer saw the impressions Choose how many impressions the viewer must have seen before seeing this ad. Add a \"no bid\" User interaction rule set to impressions , where you choose from how many Impressions the viewer is not allowed to be targeted anymore For example: A campaign may be created with 3 Substrategies Substrategy 1, has some linked Ad which introduces the viewer to a problem. It has a \"required for bid\" User interaction rule set to 0 impressions It has a \"no bid\" User interaction rule set to 1 impressions. It will therefore only target people who have not seen any ads. Substrategy 2, has a different Ad which shows the viewer a solution to the problem (the Advertiser's product). It has a \"required for bid\" User interaction rule set to 1 impressions It has a \"no bid\" User interaction rule set to 4 impressions. it will therefore only target people who have seen 1, 2 or 3 ads. Since it can only target people who have already seen an ad, this also means that they must have seen the first Ad already. Substrategy 3, has a final Ad which shows the viewer satisfied customers of Advertiser's products. It has a \"required for bid\" User interaction rule set to 4 impressions. It has no \"no bid\" User interaction rule As it can only target people who have seen 4 ads, this means that it must target people who have seen the first ad once and the second ad 3 times. it will not stop targeting them up until the Campaign user frequency cap.","title":"Advanced substrategy ideas"},{"location":"getting-ahead/advanced-substrategies.html#advanced-substrategy-ideas","text":"In most cases where you need to set up a complex targeting scenario, Substrategies are the easiest way to set it up.

For example: You're running a campaign that targets people on desktop web Within a specific city Between 9 and 5 With a specific set of ads. For a total campaign budget of 10.000 euros You also suspect that the targeted audience of the Advertiser is interested in business , sports and food and you've made three domain white Lists , each corresponding to one of these interests. Using a single campaign The easiest option is to simply make a single Campaign that targets each of the Lists . By setting it up as a single campaign means that the machine learning algorithm will determine how well each domain performs for the campaign and that it will target the domains that perform better. This however also means that you have no choice but to accept the outcome; if the algorithm decides that there is only a single domain that is optimal, then it will ignore the others and there is little you can do there. Using multiple campaigns If you would therefore like to have more control over how the budget is divided over each of the three interest Lists , another option would be to duplicate the original campaign three times and assign each duplicate campaign a budget and a single interest list. This however has some downsides: If you now want to make any generic changes to the targeting of the campaign, for example, to bid from 9 to 6 rather than from 9 to 5. Then you will have to repeat this change three times for each of the duplicates. If it turns out that 1 of the 3 interest lists has very little inventory available and it is simply impossible to spend the intended budget, then you will have to make manual adjustments to distribute this budget to the other duplicate campaigns. With just three variations this might still be managable, but issues rapidly become worse with more variations. Luckily there is another option: Substrategies Substrategies are created within a Campaign and act like mini-campaigns that follow all the targeting settings of the Campaign . For each Substrategy additional targeting rules on top of the Campaign settings can be specified, plus an intended percentage of the total campaign budget that it is supposed to spend. Using Substrategies has a number of advantages: You only have to specify the \"generic\" settings once within the Campaign , and any subsequent updates to them automatically affect all Substrategies linked to the Campaign In case you later decide to give one strategy a larger or smaller portion of the budget, redistributing budget is very easy. Simply adjust the percentage assigned to the Substrategy without having to think how this affects the total campaign budget. You have the option to choose what should happen in case a Substrategy is not able to spend its designated part of the budget in case its inventory is too limited. Either the unspent budget is automatically redistributed over the other substrategies, or it is not spent at all. Note If your Campaign has a total impressions limit, then this is limit is also divided over the Substrategies using the assigned percentage. Just like for Campaigns , both constraints are always respected and neither will be broken. How to set up Substrategies Substrategies are created within the campaign settings at the tab substrategies . You can start by creating at least 2 substrategies.

Check if the Campaign type is set to Retargeting If this is the case check whether any Segments have been linked (at the Segments tab of the Campaign ).

To quickly see if your Campaigns are reaching their progression goals open up the Campaigns tab. This can be done on any of the following levels: Agency Advertiser Campaign group , only if you have assigned your Campaign to a Campaign group The Campaigns tab consists of 3 separate sections: Recent campaigns , this contains all Campaigns that have not ended yet. Older campaigns , all the campaigns that have already ended. Archived campaigns , contains all the Campaigns that are no longer useful and have been archived . Recent campaigns In this table you can monitor the progression of your Campaigns very quickly. Status The current status of the Campaign. Possible values include: Active , the Campaign has been activated and the start and end date allow it to bid. Paused , the Campaign has not been activated \u2013 or has been deactivated \u2013 but the start and end date would allow it to bid. Not scheduled , the Campaign has not yet been activated (scheduled), but its start time is in the future. Scheduled , the Campaign has been activated (scheduled), but its start time is in the future. Ended , the end date of the Campaign has passed. Archived , the Campaign has been Archived . Ads Shows the number of linked Ads to the Campaign , if the number is 0, then the Campaign cannot bid and you should link active Ads to the Campaign . Impressions, clicks, conversions, costs Several statistics aggregated over the selected time period. Budget The money spent compared to the budget. The dashed line indicates where the spent would be if the budget were spent entirely evenly over the entire Campaign duration. The filled in portion of the bar indicates the portion of budget that was spent thus far. If the filled portion is behind the dashed line, then this indicates that the spent is behind the \u201cexpected\u201d evenly spent schedule. If the filled portion exceeds the dashed line then the actual spent exceeds the expected spent. The color of the bar will typically indicate whether an action is required. A red bar, typically means that something is wrong. The budget is likely very far behind schedule. For possible reasons you might want to check out the section \"Why is my campaign not running?\" . If the Campaign has only just started, or was started after the indicated Campaign start time , then nothing might be wrong but the Campaign is simply still catching up. An orange bar, indicates that the Campaign is slightly behind schedule. This is not necessarily a problem and you might simply want to wait to see if it improves. However if the problem persists without improvement then you might want to widen up targeting options or increase the maximum bid price . A green bar, indicates that the Campaign is running just fine and you do not need to worry about anything. By hovering over the budget bar, the percentage of the current expected spent is displayed. To see whether a Campaign is improving and catching up you may want to keep track of whether this percentage is increasing or decreasing. If a Campaign is behind on its schedule, it will not attempt to get back on schedule right away by spending a lot at once. Instead, it will divide however much it is behind and distribute it over the entire Campaign duration. This prevents inefficient bidding and overpaying to try to catch up quickly, but may have the appearance of the Campaign not being able to catch up. If you feel like the Campaign is not catching up quickly enough then you might want to consider turning on Frontloading on the Campaign. Pacing Shows the number of impressions the Campaign has done. If the max number impressions has been set within the Campaign , then the pacing column will behave the same way the Budget column does. In this case the number of done impressions will act as the spend, and the max number impressions as the budget. If this is the case, then the behavior of the budget column will be slightly modified. If the Campaign is limited by the set Budget in staying on track for the number of Impressions then the budget bar will be red. If the budget is however not restrictive, then the bar will be green. Note Hovering over a Campaign\u2019s name will show whatever is set under Campaign remarks within the Campaign settings. This can be used as a useful tool to monitor progress: add the date and the current % of budget or impressions to track progress. Or it can be used to communicate changes to your team or future self about the campaign. Pacing graphs To get more detailed insights into the campaign progress, a graph can be opened for both the budget and pacing metrics by clicking the 'view chart'-icon next to the metrics bar. In this chart the 'spent' line shows the actual performance of the campaign in the past. For campaigns that have not finished yet, performance until the end of the campaign can be predicted based on performance of the campaign on the 1, 3, or 7 most recent days. Additionally there is a 'goal' line, which indicates the performance required by the campaign to meet its goal. This line is based on the campaign configuration at the start of the campaign.

The dashed line indicates where the spent would be if the budget were spent entirely evenly over the entire Campaign duration. The filled in portion of the bar indicates the portion of budget that was spent thus far. If the filled portion is behind the dashed line, then this indicates that the spent is behind the \u201cexpected\u201d evenly spent schedule. If the filled portion exceeds the dashed line then the actual spent exceeds the expected spent. The color of the bar will typically indicate whether an action is required. A red bar, typically means that something is wrong. The budget is likely very far behind schedule. For possible reasons you might want to check out the section \"Why is my campaign not running?\" . If the Campaign has only just started, or was started after the indicated Campaign start time , then nothing might be wrong but the Campaign is simply still catching up. An orange bar, indicates that the Campaign is slightly behind schedule. This is not necessarily a problem and you might simply want to wait to see if it improves. However if the problem persists without improvement then you might want to widen up targeting options or increase the maximum bid price . A green bar, indicates that the Campaign is running just fine and you do not need to worry about anything. By hovering over the budget bar, the percentage of the current expected spent is displayed. To see whether a Campaign is improving and catching up you may want to keep track of whether this percentage is increasing or decreasing. If a Campaign is behind on its schedule, it will not attempt to get back on schedule right away by spending a lot at once. Instead, it will divide however much it is behind and distribute it over the entire Campaign duration. This prevents inefficient bidding and overpaying to try to catch up quickly, but may have the appearance of the Campaign not being able to catch up. If you feel like the Campaign is not catching up quickly enough then you might want to consider turning on Frontloading on the Campaign.","title":"Budget"},{"location":"getting-further/campaigns.html#pacing","text":"Shows the number of impressions the Campaign has done.
