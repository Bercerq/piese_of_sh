# Deals

_Deals_ are made with external parties like publishers about specific types of inventory or prices. Sometimes inventory is not available at all without a _Deal_ with the publisher.  

If you’ve made a _Deal_ with a publisher, then this _Deal_ will typically be entered into the Supply Side Platform _(SSP)_ of their choice. To use the _Deal_ the publisher needs to let you know the _Deal’s_ code or id and the _SSP_ that they are using.  

This _Deal_ can then be added within the adscience system

## Request a Deal

For some publishers you can also request a deal directly using our system. As soon as the publisher approves the deal, it can be used within our system, just like any other deal.
Currently this functionality is only available for _STER_ 

* Open up the _Deals_ section from the side bar
* Click _+ Request Deal_ to create a new deal
    * Select the publisher from the dropdown
    * Add a message for the publisher _(optional)_
    * Add a name for the deal
    * Add a description
    * Pick an expiration date
    * Select for on what level the deal should be requested: An _Organization_, _Agency_ or _Advertiser_
    * Pick the _Organization_, _Agency_ or _Advertiser_ from the list

## Link deal

You can now link the _Deal_ to Campaigns, by going to the inventory tab of the Campaign settings and selecting the _Deal_

* If you’ve added a _Deal_ to the Campaign then it will **only** bid if the _Deal’s_ identifier is present. If external targeting options have been added to the _Deal_, then it won’t be necessary to set these up within your _Campaign_.
