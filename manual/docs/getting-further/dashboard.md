# Working with the dashboard

For most users the dashboard will be the only way of interacting with the adscience system, understanding where you can find what you want to do is therefore very important.

The dashboard can be soft divided into 2 categories, although for ease of use these have been meld together: 

* The settings part, where you set up who will see your ads.
* The reporting part, where you see how these settings are working out for you, and whether you  might want to make some adjustments.

## Settings

The settings part is divided in a tree like structure:

* On top we have the Agency
    * Below that the Advertisers, which have:
        * _Ads_, to be used by _Campaigns_
        * Website visitors and customers grouped together into _Segments_
        * _Campaigns_, which may also be grouped together into _Campaign Groups_
        * _Deals_, that may have been made with external publishing parties.

For each of these levels **Statistics** and a **History** of changed settings is available
