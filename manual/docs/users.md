# User management

*User management* is available from the side bar if you have _admin_ rights. 

With _admin_ rights you are allowed to:

* invite new _Users_ 
* assign additional roles or rights to existing users
* take away role or rights from users.

## Roles

Roles can be assigned on different levels. Depending on the level you are _admin_ available levels may be:

* Organization
* Agency
* Advertiser

On the chosen level you will then assign the rights to a specific *Entity* of that level (e.g. if you choose level Advertiser, then you will pick a specific Advertiser).

You can then pick the specific role that you have in mind for the *User*

Available roles are:

* Admin
* Campaign manager
* Campaign optimizer
* Ad uploader
* Tag manager
* Guest

## Admin
The *admin* has the rights to do anything for the chosen entity. This includes:

* Creating new Users and assigning rights to them
* (On the Agency level) Creating new *Advertisers* and setting the *Agency fee* if applicable 
* Uploading Ads
* Creating Advertiser Segments
* Creating and managing Lists
* Creating and managing Deals
* Creating and managing Campaign settings
* Setting budgets to Campaigns
* Seeing all detailed financial costs and data

## Campaign manager
The _Campaign manager_ can do most things the _admin_ can do with the exception of:

* Creating new Users and assigning rights to them

The things they can do are:

* (On the Agency level) Creating new *Advertisers* **but these will always use the default Agency fee**
* Uploading Ads
* Creating Advertiser Segments
* Creating and managing Lists
* Creating and managing Deals
* Creating and managing Campaign settings
* Setting budgets to Campaigns
* Seeing all detailed financial costs and data

## Campaign optimizer
The next level below the _Campaign manager_ is the _Campaign optimizer_, which cannot:

* Create new Users or assign rights to them
* Create Advertisers
* Create new Advertiser segments
* See all the detailed financials costs - ** instead only the financial costs from the client's perspective are shown **

The things that the _Campaign Optimizer_ can do are:

* Creating and managing Lists
* Creating and managing Deals
* Uploading Ads
* Creating and managing Campaign settings
* Seeing the *Campaign* performance statistics
* If an *admin* or *campaign manager* has specified the *advertiser fee*, the cost for the customer

## Ad uploader
The Ad uploader as the name suggests solely has *Ad* uploading rights.

## Tag manager
The Tag manager solely has the rights to manage *Advertiser Segments*. 

## Guest
Guest accounts have the rights to see some information, but not to create or update anything. They have the rights to see:

* *Campaign* targeting settings
* *Campaign* performance statistics
* If an *admin* or *campaign manager* has set the advertiser fee, the cost that he owes you.

## Combining roles

It is possible to assign multiple roles on the same or different levels. To switch between roles you can click your name in the top right corner and selecting the role that you would like to use.
