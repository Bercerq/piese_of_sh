# Setting up an advertiser

Within the adscience system _Advertisers_ are the basic building block. _Advertisers_ own most things:

* _Ads_, are uploaded to their _Ad vault_
* (Advertising) _Campaigns_, are created within them
* Website visitors and customers can be grouped into their _Segments_ and be targeted
* _Deals_ with external parties, are registered within the _Advertiser_
* _Advertisers_ can make their own sets of domain blacklists or whitelists
* _Users_ with limited edit and/or viewing rights, are available to _Advertisers_ to offer people a (real time) look without intruding on settings
* If your _Advertiser_ has multiple stores or _Branches_ then these can be created and used in the _Retail_ section of the _Advertiser_

Setting up an _Advertiser_ can be done by navigating to the tab _Advertisers_ and pressing the +Add button

You will need to specify: 

* the advertiser's name
* the advertiser's domain
* The (optional) percentage of spent that the advertiser pays towards your agency as a fee (can be set to 0).
