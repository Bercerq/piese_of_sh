# Retail 
**(This section is only available for retail campaigns)**

In this section, the retail-specific settings of the campaign can be configured. This page contains two sections. In the first section the general retail-related settings of the campaign can be managed, and the second section the retail branches for the campaign can be configured.

### Retail - GPS based / Retail - Postal code based
This section contains the global targeting settings for the campaign. Over here the total budget that will be distributed over all campaigns can be set. Changes to the budget will be reflected in the settings of the 'retail branches'-section below. A global maximum bid price and impression cap can be set as well.

### Retail branches
This section contains the retail branches that are targeted by the campaign. Initially the campaign budgets and impression caps will be evenly distributed over the retail branches, but when desired these settings can be tuned per individual branch by using the edit button. The campaign totals in the top section will be changed automatically when those individual settings are modified.

Additionally, the default targeting settings (postal codes or GPS settings), landing page and custom fields that are set globally for the retail branch, can be overridden for this campaign.
