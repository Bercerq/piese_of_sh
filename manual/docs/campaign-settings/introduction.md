# Introduction

When creating a _Campaign_ a few general settings need to be defined of which some are unchangeable.

These unchangeable settings are displayed by the symbols to the left of the campaign name. These include:

* The ad type:
    * Display
    * Video
* The bidding type:
    * Real time bidding
    * Adserving only
* The campaign type:
    * Prospecting
    * Retargeting
    * Retail

For more information about these settings you can check the [Setting up a Campaign section][campaign] .

While in general the _Campaign_ settings are generic accross these different types, there are some differences.

Whenever some setting is only available for specific creation types, this will be explicitly mentioned in the documentation.
