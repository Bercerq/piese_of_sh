## Geo targeting

By setting up geo targeting you can limit where people are reached

* _Country_
* _Region_
* _City_
    * _City_ also allows the option to target in a radius around the specified cities.

In case both _regions_ and _cities_ are specified, the targeting is on everybody that falls in one of the regions or in one of the cities. In case a _country_ is selected, and _cities_ or _regions_ that are not inside the _country_ are selected, these _cities_ and _regions_ are seen as mistakes and are not actually targeted. In this case, only _cities_ and _regions_ inside the selected _countries_ are targeted.

For more advanced geo targeting â€“ for example gps based, see the [**Advanced Rules section**][advanced-rules] of the _Campaign Settings_.
