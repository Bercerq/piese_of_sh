## Advertiser segments

## Audience segments
Segments that do not belong to the *Advertiser* can also be used. The segments of DigitalAudience are divided by several demographic attributes. Some of these attributes include:

* Gender
* Age
* Employment
* Child age
* Household income
* Property value

The cost of using the DigitalAudience segments is calculated per impression and automatically included in your maximum bid price; The cost of each impression will therefore never exceed your maximum bid price.
